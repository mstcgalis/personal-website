<p>Can tracking become an exciting and creative practice instead of a boring chore? As a part of my <a href="https://www.are.na/prompt-club/tool-a-week">TOOL A WEEK</a> commitment, I worked on a better habit-tracking method, that anyone could potentially modify and use on their journey. After a week of ideation, research, sketching, prototyping and a round of feedback from designer friends, I created a customisable system called <strong>Ritual Sketching</strong>.</p>
<p>First some definitions:</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A <strong>habit</strong>  is a routine of behaviour that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the sake of this tool, I will define <strong>ritual</strong> as a positive habit being built intentionally and performed mindfully. Beyond repetition, rituals can provide a way to structure time and direct one's attention to meaningful pursuits.</p>
<p>Like many others, I have been slowly trying to build everyday habits since reading James Clear's amazing Atomic Habits. One of the techniques he recommends is &quot;habit tracking&quot; - keeping a record of how consistently you are performing certain activities, hence turning them into habits. You can read about the benefits of tracking in this <a href="https://www.are.na/block/14441936">summary</a>.</p>

<p>For a total time of about 2 months, I've used an analogue tracker in the form of a spreadsheet printed on an A4. Here are my thoughts:</p>
<h3 id="the-good" tabindex="-1">The Good <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-good">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>analogue tracking is very satisfying</li>
<li>hanging on the wall next to my table creates a physical presence in my environment, which is very powerful</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-bad" tabindex="-1">The bad <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-bad">#</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>tracking only a boolean value is reductive</li>
<li>leads to performing a habit for the sake of the tracker, not for its own sake</li>
<li>analogue is not practical for travelling</li>
<li>placement on the wall is not practical for moving about</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-ugly" tabindex="-1">The ugly <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-ugly">#</a></h3>
<p>I'm not saying spreadsheets aren't beautiful, but the look quickly became stale and office-like. This is exactly the vibe I want to steer away from.</p>
<h1 id="the-ritual-sketching-method" tabindex="-1">The Ritual Sketching method <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-ritual-sketching-method">#</a></h1>
<p>The goal of <strong>Ritual Sketching</strong> is to keep a record of your habits with compounding, generative compositions. Instead of ticking a checkbox, the person using this method will create a sketch in their <strong>log</strong> according to a predetermined <strong>key</strong>. This sketch should reflect their habits on a particular day.</p>
<p>The <strong>key</strong> pairs each habit with a thing to draw. For example, my current key looks like this:</p>
<pre class="language-python" tabindex="0"><code class="language-python">PERFORM   <span class="token punctuation">:</span>   DRAW<br>meditate  <span class="token punctuation">:</span>   line<br>mantra    <span class="token punctuation">:</span>   ellipse<br>excersize <span class="token punctuation">:</span>   polygon<br>read      <span class="token punctuation">:</span>   rectangle<br>write     <span class="token punctuation">:</span>   squiggle<br>design    <span class="token punctuation">:</span>   star<br>code      <span class="token punctuation">:</span>   dots</code></pre>
<p>In the <strong>log</strong>, each day should have its section with a <strong>star(t)</strong> placed in the middle of that section. The <strong>star(t)</strong> defines the x and the y axes, providing an &quot;artificial&quot; anchor on which the &quot;natural&quot; sketching can take place. Digital example:</p>
<p><img src="/posts/attachments/tracker_start.png" alt="star(t) of the tracker"></p>
<p>When a person performs a certain habit, they draw the corresponding thing into today's section of the <strong>log</strong>. This continues throughout the day as the shapes slowly compound into a composition. A the end of the day a sketch containing information on today's activities emerges. Even though the <strong>key</strong> stays the same, each daily sketch will inevitably be unique. Seeing the effort already put in, the daily <strong>log</strong> should act as a source of motivation, as breaking the chain with an empty <strong>star(t)</strong> will not feel right. After some time has passed, changes, fluctuations, exceptions and maybe even trends can be observed.</p>
<p>With sketching, there's a lot of opportunity for non-boolean reflectivity. Some simple ideas to start with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the size of the shape reflects the length of the ritual</li>
<li>the placement of the shape reflects the time of day the ritual was performed</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="my-implementation-and-templates" tabindex="-1">My implementation and templates <a class="header-anchor" href="#my-implementation-and-templates">#</a></h1>
<p><strong>Ritual Sketching</strong> as a system and practice can be implemented in many different forms. Here I will provide my implementation(s) along with some templates to get you started!</p>
<p>I started using an analogue tracker printed on an A4 which I hang next to my desk. One sheet contains 5 rows of 7 <strong>start(s)</strong> for a total of 35 days, which is more than enough for a month's worth of sketching. The key is printed at the top along with a space to fill out the <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> dates.</p>

<p>After ~2 weeks of tracking on the wall, I switched to using a notebook. Each day gets its own page split into two sections: <strong>tasks</strong> on the top and <strong>ritual sketching</strong> on the bottom. I think the portability of the notebook makes me use the tracker more, plus it just feels more cozy. I'll make sure to update this post if I try any other modifications or implementations.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to using this technique in the coming months, as only time will tell how well it truly works. Then there's an exciting idea I got from my friends - to implement <strong>Ritual Sketching</strong> in a paper notebook or some kind of digital space, both of which will provide an affordance to &quot;animate&quot; individual sketches into a moving picture. I'll post an update once I gather more experiences, thoughts and prototypes. Thanks for reading!</p>
