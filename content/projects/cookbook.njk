<p>
  <a href="https://cookbook.care">cookbook.care</a> is a collaboration
  between <a href="/" class="collaborator border-solid border rounded-xl !no-underline !text-cookbook-blue dark:!text-cookbook-sky">Daniel G√°lis</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/juliedudova" class="collaborator !no-underline border-solid border rounded-xl !text-cookbook-red dark:!text-cookbook-pink">Julie Dudov√°</a> based around sharing and caring while also being a FaVU school project.
</span>
<p>
  Our main goal is spreading the idea of sustainable eating (environmentally, economically and spiritually).
  <a href="https://cookbook.care">c.c</a> encourages inspiration by season and place while questioning the role recipes, focusing instead on building intuition using first principles.
</p>
<p>
  In the 2023 winter semester, we designed an app to help us cook more, use more local and seasonal ingredient and (re)learn first the principles of taste, heat, texture, and so on.
</p>
<p>
  The open-source <a href="https://cookbook.care">app</a> is based on a connections dialogue between Julie, who has been cooking without recipes for years, and Daniel, a beginner cook who appreciates the structure of a recipe.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout the semester, we have been meeting weekly to discuss our experiences with the app, our thoughts on cooking and eating, and our ideas for the future of the project.
</p>
<p>
  While the app remaines in closed beta, we have slowly been moving away from recipes, both practically and with our theory of cooking.
</p>
<p>
  In the 2024 summer semester, we are working on a publication that will document our process and ideas, and we are planning to release the app to the public in the near future.
</p>
<p>
  The following is a synthesis of our individually written reflections about the state of the project, our goals, and our (research) questions for the future of cookbook.care.
</p>
<h2>synthesis</h2>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">I love cookbook.care.</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">...I love the content we talked about in the last session</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">
  I am starting to conceptualise c.c. as an in-between space, an intersection, but one that makes sense of the whole‚Ä¶
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  finding the connections between design and food - the preparation, the ritual, the preservation.
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">
  finding a balance between the internal needs of the soul and the external demands of the outside world. A balance between hunger and craving, time capacity and season, the need for self-expression and the obligation to hand in a schoolwork.
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  btw I quite enjoy how open we are to each other, unafraid of communicating if we don't have time or feel that a session is not needed right now. it helps me to not feel forced into creating content ‚Äúon commission‚Äù.
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">
  I want this project to evolve according to our real needs, whether they're physical, mental, individual or collective.
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  i don't expect any fluctuations I guess. work and school are consistent throughout the semester.
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  I hope that in the future,
  c.c. will become a platform for sharing texts and ideas related to sustainability (in life and design), care and perception of experience (individual and collective). I want our process itself to be sustainable (recognising possible developments in context of how much time and resources we want to devote to it)
</p>
<h3>i want to create</h3>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">‚Ä¶modify the app to serve my real needs better</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  gradually work on a manifesto [no rush we have forever] - I would like to write it together, maybe during one long session. I think it is important to share a text describing the core of c.c. regarding how dialogue-oriented the project is.
</p>
<h3>i want to learn</h3>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  how to work with information and pass it on in a viable way
  knowing how to embrace a large project and structure it clearly
  being able to decide what is necessary
  a bit more political radicalism
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">
  to embrace consistent blogging about the soft poetic aspects as well as the technological research being done, but most importantly - be real and honest, creating a dialogue
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">(but I don't see any of this as something that has to happen)</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">What we are doing and thinking about is simultaneously hyper-personal and hyper-universal.</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  i feel like a lot of people don't like to eat/prepare food at home because it looks ugly and it's not "fun". i believe the only food styling you need is a basic colour scheme. like if you get a chopped-up radish, red tomatoes in season, fresh cucumber and good bread with some butter, you just have to like it, right? and you don't need basil gel and papaya shavings.
  right now, the ‚Äúmain‚Äù thing is finding a shareable outcome (for this semester)
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">c.c. is by us, for us, but also potentially for everyone, by everyone</p>
<h2>questions</h2>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  Why is this project important to you?
  When you ignore the team (Daniel + Julie), what do you, personally want to experience, discover, and create?
  What is worth our energy? How much do you want to put in? What metrics can be used to gauge one‚Äôs energy?
  What feasible outcomes are there? What are their pros and cons?
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">
  The essential function of a recipe is documenting an experience for oneself and others, thus preserving and accumulating knowledge. But following exact recipes also limits the development of one‚Äôs intuition and sharpening of one's senses, instead trusting the opinion of an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù in order to achieve a certain reproducible, ‚Äúbranded‚Äù meal. Following instructions can feel like a game, but it also feels restraining and creates unnecessary expectations. Similar to society's roles, a recipe is something you have to fit into.
  How can we redesign recipes so that they still preserve knowledge, but don't perpetuate the toxic nature of exactness?
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  We agreed to make c.c. as open-source as possible - no author‚Äôs license. Is it possible to achieve this without hurting the ego?
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">
  In the recent interview with Bublinka we mentioned our aversion to creating another ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù instead of redesigning recipes. Can we avoid the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù paradigm? Is sharing and offering your point of view without a specific guide the only way, or can we find a middle ground?
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-blue dark:text-cookbook-sky">
  In my opinion, the AIs of today (LLMs, LIMs‚Ä¶) are better described as ‚Äúvery limited artificial intuition‚Äù rather than ‚Äúartificial intelligence‚Äù. Everything they produce is made up on the spot, referencing training data in a hazy rather than exact way. Can we leverage computer intuition in building our intuition?
</p>
<p class="text-cookbook-red dark:text-cookbook-pink">Is there something c.c. related that you would like to read, but it doesn't exist (yet)?</p>
