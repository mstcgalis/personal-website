Tomado is a very simple timer app based on the pomodoro technique for concentration. It lives in the MacOS Menu Bar, dutifully counting minutes while you work. When the time for a break comes, Tomado lets you know.

The lengths of work bouts, short breaks and long breaks can be adjusted, along with other options. Daily and weekly stats are also available.

I have been personally using this tool for three years, and it has become an integrated part of my routine without feeling restrictive or forceful.
