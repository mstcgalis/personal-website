pff is not a band. it’s a way of playing music, creating sounds and living life. it stands on freestyling, letting your emotions control things you do and mainly - having fun.

open jam session is a participatory, inclusive, collaborative audio performance. anyone and everyone is invited to join in with their voice, electronic or acoustic instruments, or whatever cool-sounding objects may be around.

honza and daniel act as participants and facilitators, ensuring everyone’s technical needs are met and creating an open and safe space.

let’s connect together through freestyling, letting our emotions guide the sounds we create and most importantly - have fun.
