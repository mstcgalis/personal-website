# Public Digital Darden?
I think I want to keep my notes and my blog separate, but build a really easy way to turn one into the other. I have been writing in my Obsidian for a while now, but I don't think hosting all of my notes publicly can bring me or anyone sense, value or joy. Yes, kinds of digital gardens are fun to explore for a while, but I much prefer reading more traditional blogposts. I think my [are.na](https://are.na/danielgalis) is a great public #second-brain. Anyone truly interested can scower through through the large number of channels and a get a good sense what I'm thinking about and what I'm vibing with. Some notes are best kept private.

The main thing to figure out then is the pipeline from note to blog. This should be controlled by text only, no buttons, no extra formatting, ideally no copy and paste. Just type something in the note's [Front Matter](https://frontmatter.codes/docs/markdown) that automatically turns it into a blogpost. Or, well, makes it public. I don't (want to) know what a blogpost is and isn't.

My main goal is to use & reference my website (almost) daily. It is first and foremost mine. A tool for thought, but more generally a tool for digital being, or just for being. Just a tool. Not really a portfolio, not a SEO-maxxed blog, not something you link to in your bio just to get traction on some new product. No bullshit. Although, it can become all those things, and more, new features emerging out of my actual use. The MVP is made by me for me. Later, my website can become more inclusive and/or participatory.

# Ways I Would Like To Use a Website
Posting texts, mostly reflections on things I learned, made, read and done. They should be atomic, focused on a single topic.

Editing these texts continually. The posting is more a start than a finish.

Opening a window into my life for anyone interested. Sharing up to date information about what I'm up to currently.

Presenting my work in a way that is easy to navigate and explore.

Tracking some metrics about my #rituals. Sport is good example: I want to have a place for marking PR's. Why do this in public? Idk, I think it will make me more accountable. Also it just seems like a cool thing to do.

Aggregating and categorising content from different places. [are.na](https://are.na/danielgalis) + Obsidian basically, but in a structured, nice way. Linking channels on [are.na](https://are.na/danielgalis) to tags/notes in Obsidian.

Experimenting with the interface and interactions. Hopefully building a tag based search and general keyboard interface later on.

# Principles To Keep In Mind
- A tool for me first, an interface with the public second.
- Less is more.
- Experiment.
