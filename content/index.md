# Hi! I'm Daniel.

I create (digital) tools and practices that empower individuals and communities.

Interested in [#rituals](tags/rituals), keeping a [#second-brain](tags/second-brain), calm technology, thinking through making, and beautiful [#computers](tags/computers).

No matter what I do - I am always community-driven. That is the most truthful way to describe my ambitions in every pursuit.
