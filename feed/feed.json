			"content_html": "<p>Can tracking become an exciting and creative practice instead of a boring chore? As a part of my <a href=\"https://www.are.na/prompt-club/tool-a-week\">TOOL A WEEK</a> commitment, I worked on a better habit-tracking method, that anyone could potentially modify and use on their journey. After a week of ideation, research, sketching, prototyping and a round of feedback from designer friends, I created a customisable system called <strong>Ritual Sketching</strong>.</p>\n<p>First some definitions:</p>\n<p>From <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habit\">Wikipedia</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A <strong>habit</strong>  is a routine of behaviour that is repeated regularly and tends to occur subconsciously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For the sake of this tool, I will define <strong>ritual</strong> as a positive habit being built intentionally and performed mindfully. Beyond repetition, rituals can provide a way to structure time and direct one's attention to meaningful pursuits.</p>\n<p>Like many others, I have been slowly trying to build everyday habits since reading James Clear's amazing Atomic Habits. One of the techniques he recommends is &quot;habit tracking&quot; - keeping a record of how consistently you are performing certain activities, hence turning them into habits. You can read about the benefits of tracking in this <a href=\"https://www.are.na/block/14441936\">summary</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"my-experience-with-habit-tracking\" tabindex=\"-1\">My experience with habit tracking <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h1>\n<p><img src=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/attachments/table_tracker.png\" alt=\"table tracker\"></p>\n<p>For a total time of about 2 months, I've used an analogue tracker in the form of a spreadsheet printed on an A4. Here are my thoughts:</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-good\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Good <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>analogue tracking is very satisfying</li>\n<li>hanging on the wall next to my table creates a physical presence in my environment, which is very powerful</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-bad\" tabindex=\"-1\">The bad <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>tracking only a boolean value is reductive</li>\n<li>leads to performing a habit for the sake of the tracker, not for its own sake</li>\n<li>analogue is not practical for travelling</li>\n<li>placement on the wall is not practical for moving about</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"the-ugly\" tabindex=\"-1\">The ugly <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h3>\n<p>I'm not saying spreadsheets aren't beautiful, but the look quickly became stale and office-like. This is exactly the vibe I want to steer away from.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-ritual-sketching-method\" tabindex=\"-1\">The Ritual Sketching method <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h1>\n<p>The goal of <strong>Ritual Sketching</strong> is to keep a record of your habits with compounding, generative compositions. Instead of ticking a checkbox, the person using this method will create a sketch in their <strong>log</strong> according to a predetermined <strong>key</strong>. This sketch should reflect their habits on a particular day.</p>\n<p>The <strong>key</strong> pairs each habit with a thing to draw. For example, my current key looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"language-python\" tabindex=\"0\"><code class=\"language-python\">PERFORM   <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>   DRAW<br>meditate  <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>   line<br>mantra    <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>   ellipse<br>excersize <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>   polygon<br>read      <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>   rectangle<br>write     <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>   squiggle<br>design    <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>   star<br>code      <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span>   dots</code></pre>\n<p>In the <strong>log</strong>, each day should have its section with a <strong>star(t)</strong> placed in the middle of that section. The <strong>star(t)</strong> defines the x and the y axes, providing an &quot;artificial&quot; anchor on which the &quot;natural&quot; sketching can take place. Digital example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/attachments/start_tracker.png\" alt=\"star(t) of the tracker\"></p>\n<p>When a person performs a certain habit, they draw the corresponding thing into today's section of the <strong>log</strong>. This continues throughout the day as the shapes slowly compound into a composition. A the end of the day a sketch containing information on today's activities emerges. Even though the <strong>key</strong> stays the same, each daily sketch will inevitably be unique. Seeing the effort already put in, the daily <strong>log</strong> should act as a source of motivation, as breaking the chain with an empty <strong>star(t)</strong> will not feel right. After some time has passed, changes, fluctuations, exceptions and maybe even trends can be observed.</p>\n<p>With sketching, there's a lot of opportunity for non-boolean reflectivity. Some simple ideas to start with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the size of the shape reflects the length of the ritual</li>\n<li>the placement of the shape reflects the time of day the ritual was performed</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"my-implementation-and-templates\" tabindex=\"-1\">My implementation and templates <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h1>\n<p><strong>Ritual Sketching</strong> as a system and practice can be implemented in many different forms. Here I will provide my implementation(s) along with some templates to get you started!</p>\n<p>I started using an analogue tracker printed on an A4 which I hang next to my desk. One sheet contains 5 rows of 7 <strong>start(s)</strong> for a total of 35 days, which is more than enough for a month's worth of sketching. The key is printed at the top along with a space to fill out the <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> dates.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pdf-templates\" tabindex=\"-1\">PDF Templates: <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/attachments/templates_tracker/MINE.pdf\">the exact one I use</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/attachments/templates_tracker/BLANK_BLANK.pdf\">fully blank</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/attachments/templates_tracker/BLANK_SHAPES.pdf\">blank rituals + &quot;shapes&quot; key</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/attachments/templates_tracker/BLANK_ABSTRACT.pdf\">blank rituals + &quot;abstract&quot; key</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/attachments/templates_tracker/BLANK_OBJECTS.pdf\">blank rituals + &quot;objects&quot; key</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"update\" tabindex=\"-1\">Update <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h1>\n<p>After ~2 weeks of tracking on the wall, I switched to using a notebook. Each day gets its own page split into two sections: <strong>tasks</strong> on the top and <strong>ritual sketching</strong> on the bottom. I think the portability of the notebook makes me use the tracker more, plus it just feels more cozy. I'll make sure to update this post if I try any other modifications or implementations.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/attachments/notebook_tracker.jpeg\" alt=\"photo of my notebook\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"final-thoughts\" tabindex=\"-1\">Final thoughts <a class=\"header-anchor\" href=\"https://danielgalis.com/blog/ritual-sketching/\">#</a></h1>\n<p>I'm looking forward to using this technique in the coming months, as only time will tell how well it truly works. Then there's an exciting idea I got from my friends - to implement <strong>Ritual Sketching</strong> in a paper notebook or some kind of digital space, both of which will provide an affordance to &quot;animate&quot; individual sketches into a moving picture. I'll post an update once I gather more experiences, thoughts and prototypes. Thanks for reading!</p>\n",
